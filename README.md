# 🤖 AI Code Reviewer & Debugger

An AI-powered web application that reviews Python code, detects bugs, suggests improvements, and provides corrected code using Generative AI.

---

## ⭐ Overview

**AI Code Reviewer & Debugger** is an intelligent web-based tool built to assist developers in writing better Python code. The application analyzes user-submitted code, identifies logical and syntactical issues, suggests optimizations, and generates corrected versions using Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project was developed as part of my **Data Science & Generative AI Internship at Innomatics Research Labs**, focusing on real-world applications of Generative AI and prompt-driven workflows.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Developers often face challenges such as:

🐞 Undetected bugs in Python code  
⏱️ Time-consuming debugging  
📉 Poor code quality or readability  
❓ Lack of clear feedback on improvements  

Manual code review is slow and error-prone.  
This project automates the review and debugging process using **LLM-powered intelligence**.

## ⚡ Key Features

🧪 **Code Review** – Analyzes Python code for logic, syntax, and best practices  
🐞 **Bug Detection** – Identifies potential errors and problematic code blocks  
🛠️ **Fix Suggestions** – Provides corrected and optimized code  
🧠 **Generative AI Reasoning** – Explains why issues occur and how to fix them  
🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple and interactive web UI using Streamlit  

---

## 🧠 System Workflow

User enters Python code →  
Prompt-engineered request sent to LLM →  
Model reviews code →  
Returns:
• Issues  
• Bug explanations  
• Suggested fixes  
• Improved version of code  

All results are displayed in a clean web interface.
